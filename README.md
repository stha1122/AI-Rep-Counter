 The project focuses on creating an program to help you exercise, by determining the quality and quantity of repetitions which is done by using pose estimation running on the CPU. The AI Rep Counter consists of a pose recognition unit and a fitness movement analysis unit. The system captures the user's pose with a fixed camera. This application uses MediaPipe to detect a personâ€™s pose, and afterwards analyses the geometry of the pose in real-time video and counts the repetitions of the particular exercise.
